# Login Fix Guide

## The Problem
After implementing the security fixes, the login is failing because:
1. The old Firebase API key was revoked
2. The new secure configuration system needs a new API key
3. Node.js server is not available to serve the configuration

## Quick Fix Steps

### Step 1: Get Your New Firebase API Key
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project "CoreTrex Internal Dashboard"
3. Go to Project Settings (gear icon in top left)
4. Go to the "General" tab
5. Scroll down to "Your apps" section
6. Find your web app and click on it
7. Copy the new API key

### Step 2: Update the Configuration
1. Open `firebase-config.js` in your code editor
2. Find this line:
   ```javascript
   apiKey: "YOUR_NEW_API_KEY_HERE", // Replace this with your new API key
   ```
3. Replace `YOUR_NEW_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual new API key
4. Save the file

### Step 3: Test the Login
1. Open your application in a web browser
2. Try to log in with Google
3. The login should now work

## What This Fix Does
- Uses a direct configuration approach instead of server-side loading
- Keeps your API key secure by not exposing it in version control
- Maintains the same functionality as before

## Security Note
This is a temporary solution. For production, you should:
1. Install Node.js
2. Set up the server with environment variables
3. Use the server-side configuration approach

## Troubleshooting
If login still fails:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Make sure you replaced the API key correctly
3. Verify that Google Authentication is enabled in your Firebase project
4. Check that your domain is authorized in Firebase Authentication settings
